Robert Duggan, CEO of biotech drugmaker Pharmacyclics PCYC,  will pocket over $3.5 billion from the company’s sale to AbbVie ABBV, one of the biggest paydays ever from the buyout of a publicly held company.

Under terms of the deal, Duggan will receive $3.55 billion for his 13.6 million shares, about an 18% stake in the biotech company, according to corporate filings.

Other senior execs are set for big payouts as well, including Chief Operating Officer Mahkam Zanganeh, whose shares are worth nearly $224.6 million, and director David Smith, who will pocket nearly $46.5 million. All told, directors and senior executives could  receive nearly $4 billion in merger-related payments, Pharmacyclics says.

Duggan, 70, is a longtime private venture investor and was CEO of surgical systems maker Computer Motion until it was acquired by Intuitive Surgical  ISRG in 2003.

Duggan began buying Pharmacyclics stock in 2004, eventually amassing nearly a 25% stake. But  by 2008, shares had fallen below $1.  The company’s fortunes turned on chronic lymphocytic leukemia treatment Imbruvica and a series of drug industry mergers.

Pharmacyclics shares currently trade at about $258.  Takeover speculation – including interest  from Imbruvica partner Johnson & Johnson  JNJ – have boosted Pharmacyclics 119%  this year alone, based on Tuesday’s $257.75 close.

Duggan has declined compensation from the company since becoming CEO in 2008.
